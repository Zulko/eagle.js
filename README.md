### For a quick tour, see [this slideshow](https://zulko.github.io/eaglejs-demo/#/introducing-eagle):

<p align="center"><a href="https://zulko.github.io/eaglejs-demo/#/introducing-eagle" target="_blank"><img alt="screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zulko/eagle.js/master/img/screenshot.jpg"></a></p>


Most of all, eagle.js aims at offering a simple and very hackable API so you
can get off the beaten tracks and craft the slideshows you really want.

Here is what the eagle.js syntax looks like (Example here are using [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), but you can still use plain HTML):
```pug
.eg-slideshow
    slide
      h1 My slideshow
      h4 By Zulko

    slide
      h3 Title of this slide
      p  Paragraph 1.
      p  Paragraph 2.

    slide(:steps=3)
      h3 Slide with bullet points
      p(v-if='step >= 2') This will appear first.
      p(v-if='step >= 3') This will appear second.
```

If you are not familiar with Vue.js you will find eagle.js harder to use than, say, [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), but on the long term eagle.js makes it easier to organize your slides and implement new ideas.

## Get started

You must have Node.js/npm installed to use eagle.js.

Then the best to get started is to clone [the example repo](https://github.com/Zulko/eaglejs-demo):
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Zulko/eaglejs-demo.git
```

Install the dependencies (they will only be downloaded in a local folder):
```bash
$ cd eaglejs-demo
$ npm install
```

Then run ```npm run dev``` to start the server, and open your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the slideshows.

To start editing, click on ``My first slideshow`` to display this slideshow, then open the file ``eagle/src/slideshows/first-slideshow/FirstSlideshow.vue`` and change the content of the first slide. Observe the changes happen automatically in your browser. The only times you need to refresh the page is when you add remove or add slides to the presentation.

## Install

Install by npm

```bash
npm install --save eagle.js
```

Or install by yarn

```bash
yarn add eagle.js
```

## Usage

Eagle.js is a vue plugin. You need to `use` eagle.js in your vue app's main file.
<br>**New in 0.3**: `animate.css` is now a peer dependency. User need install their own version.
<br>**New in 0.6** You do not need to explicitly import the default style  anymore. 

```javascript
import Eagle from 'eagle.js'
// import animate.css for slide transition 
import 'animate.css'

Vue.use(Eagle)
```

**New in 0.5.0** Now by default eagle.js doesn't export all plugins but only core components. You have to explicitly use your widgets or plugins from now on. See more on [extensions section](https://github.com/Zulko/eagle.js#extensions)

### Basic idea

Eagle.js's basic components are `slideshow` and `slide`. You use `slideshow` as mixin to write `slideshow` component, which could include multiple `slide`s. A very basic Single File Component for `slideshow` would look like this:

```vue
<template lang="pug">
    slide(:steps="4")
      p(v-if="step >= 1")
        | {{step}}
      p(v-if="step >= 2")
        | {{step}}
      p(v-if="step >= 3")
        | {{step}}
      p(v-if="step >= 4")
        | {{step}}
</template>

<script>
import { Slideshow } from 'eagle.js'
export default {
  mixins: [Slideshow]
}
</script>
```

We use `slideshow`'s data `step` to control the conditional rendering in `slide`, thus `slideshow` is used as a mixin. Also by this way eagle.js exposes the maximum hackability to users.

### slideshow

`slideshow` can only be used as mixin. 

*Note*: For vue mixins, template cannot be extended. `slideshow` needs one HTML element to wrap around your following `slide`s because there are events registered to `slideshow` after component mounted. **We recommend you to wrap your template in a `eg-slideshow` div for default styling.** Also, do not add conditional rendering on `slideshow` (for example, add `v-if="active"` on your `slideshow` template) as it would break `slideshow`'s events registration as well.

You can configure your authored `slideshow` component with these properties: 

| Property             | Default         | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `firstSlide`         | `1`             |                                                           |
| `lastSlide`          | `null`          |                                                           |
| `startStep`          | `1`             |                                                           | 
| `mouseNavigation`    | `true`          | Navigate with mouse click or scroll event                 |
| `keyboardNavigation` | `true`          | Navigate with keyboard                                    |
| `embedded`           | `false`         |                                                           |
| `inserted`           | `false`         |                                                           |
| `onStartExit`        | `null`          | event callback for exiting slideshow through first slide  |
| `onEndExit`          | `null`          | event callback for exiting slideshow through last slide   |
| `backBySlide`        | `false`         | slideshow navigates back by step by default               |
| `repeat`             | `false`         | go to first slide automatically when reaching the last one|
| `zoom`               | `true`          | alt + click can zoom on slide                             |

More explaination on `backBySlide`:

By default, slideshow navigates back by step, but you can change the behavior to be slide based: so if you go back to the previous slide, it lands on the first step instead of last step. See a comparison:

|Back by Step: |Back by slide:|
|--------------|--------------|
|![back by step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zulko/eagle.js/master/img/backbystep.gif)|![back by slide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zulko/eagle.js/master/img/backbyslide.gif)|

Please note, if you have any embedded slideshows, you have to use default back mode, because for now parent slideshow cannot know how many steps child slideshow backs. This is a feature to be implemented in the future.

#### Nested slideshow

A nested slideshow can be an `inserted` one or an `embedded` one. If the nested slideshow's parent is a slideshow, then it's an `inserted` slideshow; if the parent is a slide, then it's an `embedded` slideshow. 
An `embedded` slideshow would have its own events and embedded styles, while an `inserted` slideshow does not. *Do not mix them up:* a `embedded` slideshow in a slideshow will replace its parent slideshow, while a `inserted` 
slideshow inside a slide will simply not work.

### slide

`slide` can be used both as mixin or component. If your want to author a complex `slide`, writing it as a seperated SFC with `slide` mixin would really help. Including the following template(pug) as wrapper in your `slide` component to keep the default style:

```pug
eg-transition(:enter='enter', :leave='leave')
  .eg-slide(v-if='active')
    .eg-slide-content
      // Your own markup...
```

You can configure `slide` with these properties:

| Property             | Default         | Description                               |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `skip`               | `false`         |                                           |
| `enter`              | `null`          | Default enter animation                   |
| `enterPrev`          | `null`          | Enter animation for prev direction        |
| `enterNext`          | `null`          | Enter animation for next direction        |
| `leave`              | `null`          | Default leave animation                   |
| `leavePrev`          | `null`          | Leave animation for prev direction        |
| `leaveNext`          | `null`          | Leave animation for next direction        |
| `steps`              | `1`             | Total steps for this slide                |
| `mouseNavigation`    | `true`          | Navigate with mouse click or scroll event |
| `keyboardNavigation` | `true`          | Navigate with keyboard                    |

`enterPrev`, `enterNext`, `leavePrev` and `leaveNext` provides flexibility if you want to customize the animation for prev/next direction. If set to null they will use default `enter` and `leave` styles.

*Note:* `enter` and `leave` must be set in pairs. Don't only set one property, because `slide` has two directions to move: prev/next, and both directions needs animations. **We recommend either you set animation for all your `slide` on both `enter` and `leave`, or don't set any at all.**

### eg-transition

Under the hood, `eg-transition` is just vue's `transition` that supports  [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/): you can use animate.css's class name for `enter` and `leave` property and it just works. All eagle.js's transition effects, including `slide`,  happen with this component, and you can use it just like using vue's `transition`.

## Extensions

Starting from 0.5.0 we introduction extensions to eagle.js. It includes two categories, namely widgets and plugins:
1. Widgets are Vue components that can be directly used in a slide.
2. Plugins are used in slideshow to enhance slide globally.

Both widgets and plugins have the same interface to use, just like how Vue uses plugins, for example:

```javascript
// plugin
Eagle.use(Zoom, {scale: 2})
// Widget
Eagle.use(CodeBlock)
```

### Widgets

Eagle.js ships several useful widgets that can be used in your `slide`:
1. `eg-modal`
2. `eg-code-block` (code highlighted by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/))
3. `eg-code-comment`
4. `eg-toggle`
5. `eg-radio-button`
6. `eg-triggered-message`

Using widgets is really simple

```javascript
import Eagle, { Modal, CodeBlock } from 'eagle.js'

Eagle.use(Modal)
Eagle.use(CodeBlock)

// You can still do this, which eagle does the same under the hood
// Vue.component(Modal.name, Modal)
// Vue.component(CodeBlock.name, CodeBlock)
```
Widgets' name follows the same rule: uppercase for importing, `eg` prefixed lowercase connected with dash in HTML.
See more of their usage in the [demo project](https://github.com/Zulko/eaglejs-demo).

*New in 0.3.0*: `highlight.js` is not a dependency anymore, so if you need to use `eg-code-block`, you need to install your own version of `highlight.js`, then specifiy it in your `main.js`:

```javascript
// import your own highlight.js(only for javascript) 
import hljs from 'highlight.js/lib/highlight';
import javascript from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/javascript';
hljs.registerLanguage('javascript', javascript);
// then pass it to eagle
import { Options } from 'eagle.js'
Options.hljs = hljs
```

This way drastically decrease eagle.js's package size and user could manage their own `highlight.js` version.

### Presenter Plugin
You can use presenter plugin to enable presenter mode:

```javascript
// first, use plugin in your entry file
import Eagle, {Presenter} from eagle.js

Eagle.use(Presenter, {
  presenterModeKey: 'a' // default is p
})

// second, in your slideshow, declare two `data` property
{
  data: function () {
    return {
      childWindow: null,
      parentWindow: null,
      // .. the rest of your data
    }
  }
}
```

Press your configured button would toggle presenter mode: you have two windows that share control with each other. Enabling presenter mode gives user two addition `data` for `slideshow`: `parentWindow` and `childWindow`. For example:

```pug
.eg-slideshow
  slide
    p Eagle.is is awesome!
    p(v-if="parentWindow") I can be a note!
    p(v-if="childWindow") I can be a note too!
```

It might be counter-intuitive that `(v-if="parentWindow")` is actually child window. It's because it means this window has a parent window, thus making itself a child window. But it is really just user's preference to put notes in either window, as two windows are almost functionally identical, except only parent window could close persenter mode.

### Zoom Plugin

You can use zoom plugin to enable zoom mode:

```javascript
import Eagle, {Zoom} from eagle.js

Eagle.use(Presenter, {
  scale: 1 // default is 2
})
```

`Option`+Click (`Alt`+click on non-Mac) would zoom in and out.

## Themes

For minimum working style,  **you need to wrap your `slideshow` template in a `eg-slideshow` container.**  Eagle.js also has two themes for now: *argume* and *gourmet*. You can import theme style instead of default one to use them:

```javascript
// in your main.js
import 'eagle.js/dist/themes/gourmet/gourmet.css'
``` 

To make theme style work, in your `slideshow` you should also have a wrapper with theme class, for example if you are using *gourmet* theme:

```html
<div class="eg-theme-gourmet">
  <div class="eg-slideshow">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

## Advanced usages

### API

If you want to customize eagle.js, most likely you will work on `slideshow` component. In this case, We recommend you to read through `slideshow`'s source code to get a better understanding of how eagle.js works. Because `slideshow` works as a vue mixin, all `data` and `method` will follow vue's [option merging rule](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/mixins.html#Option-Merging). If you are not sure about whether you overwrite eagle.js's API, you can put your functions in `afterMounted`, which eagle.js exposes explicitly for users. 

`slideshow`'s mostly used methods are `nextStep`, `previousStep`, `nextSlide`, `previousSlide`, which are pretty self-explanatory. 

### Mobile Support

Eagle.js supports basic mouse, keyboard and touch event, but doesn't support any advanced mobile gestures, like 'swipe'. Still, it is very easy to add mobile support with a well-tested library, like [hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io/).

In your slideshow component's `mounted` lifecycle hook,

```javascript
mounted: {
  // You can also register to this.$el if you want
  // to control the gesture only on your slideshow component
  const hammer = new Hammer(window)
  hammer.on('swiperight', () => {
    this.previousStep()
  })
  hammer.on('swipeleft', () => {
    this.nextStep()
  })
}
```

### Permalinks

Eagle.js does not comes with permalinks implementation, because eagle.js does not assume your usage with it. Using eagle.js as a completely standalone slideshow, like `reveal.js` or `Remark`, or as a component inserted into your routes, permalinks can get quite different. What's more, `vue-router` is not a dependency for eagle.js. So it's not a 'battery included' situtation. However, it is fairly easy to implement your own.

The most common implementation for permalinks is to use hashbang in URLs. You can achieve with with `vue-router`'s hash mode, or even better, with history mode, to get rid of the ugly hashbang. Also with `vue-router`, it gives your more flexibility and more granularity control.

For example, if we are using Eagle.js as a standalone application. In our router file:

```javascript
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/:slide/:step',
      component: MySlideshow
    }
  ]
})
```

And inside a `MySlideshow`, add watchers to update URL when slides changes, and update slides when URL changes:
```javascript
 ....
  methods: {
    ....
     updateSlides: function () {
      this.currentSlideIndex = +this.$route.params.slide
      this.$nextTick(() => {
        this.step = +this.$route.params.step
      })
    },
    updateURL: function () {
      this.$router.push(`/${this.currentSlideIndex}/${this.step}`)
    }
  },
  watch: {
    '$route': 'updateSlides',
    step: 'updateURL',
    currentSlideIndex: 'updateURL'
  }
```

[Demo](http://eaglejspermalink.surge.sh/#/introducing-eagle/2/1)

### Code splitting

Intuitively,  writing your `slide` components and then using Vue's [async component](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Async-Components) by dynamically importing `slide` components in your slideshow sounds like a perfect solution, unfortunately this won't work, as `slideshow` needs all its $children to be properly initialized. Currently, if you really need to do code splitting, you can consider splitting your `slideshow` in different routes and [lazy-loading](https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/lazy-loading.html) them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- ### (Vue-CLI v.4+) The white-spaces in my code are not preserved by the CodeBlock widget, how can I fix it?

The way Vue-CLI treats white-spaces [has changed](https://cli.vuejs.org/migrating-from-v3/#vue-cli-service) in the version 4. If you use Vue-CLI to create your slideshow, you will need to add the following configuration in your `vue.config.js` file (see [issue#90](https://github.com/Zulko/eagle.js/issues/90#issue-510662591)).

```js
// vue.config.js
module.exports = {
    chainWebpack: config => {
      config.module
        .rule('vue')
          .use('vue-loader')
            .tap(args => {
              args.compilerOptions.whitespace = 'preserve'
            })
    }
  }
```

## Contribute

Eagle.js is an open source framework originally written by [Zulko](https://github.com/Zulko) and released on [Github](https://github.com/Zulko/eagle.js) under the ISC licence. Everyone is welcome to contribute!

Below are a few ideas that deserve more attention in the future:

- Bundler to make standalone HTML presentations
- PDF export?
- Themes
- Better docs? (What do JavaScript people use to write docs?)

### Development

Eagle.js uses storybook for development:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Zulko/eagle.js.git
$ npm install
$ npm run storybook
```
